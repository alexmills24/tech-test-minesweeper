# tech-test-minesweeper
Technical assessment from Future Publishing

I have used javascript to build this minesweeper game as this is a language that I am comfortable with. 

I started by breaking down the problem into sections, the steps i followed was - 

generating the grid onto the page using JS.

generating mines to be randomly placed onto the table making sure only one mine was in one cell. 

lastly was the displaying of the clues - this section is currently not working but I have included the code I was building for you to look through.

I time boxed this challenge at 2 hours.
